h1. How to delete bucket, image & bundle

After you have successfully created several versions of your images select one and move it to production cluster. After that delete unused versions of your images from testing cluster.

First source the eucalyptus credentials of the testing cluster


    [root@<your client> ~]# . .euca/eucarc 



Get information of your images


    [root@<your client>]# euca-describe-images | grep win


Make sure that you are not running an instance which image you are about to deregister & delete. Terminate them if found.


    euca-describe-instances| grep emi-1B3F163D



Deregister the Eucalyptus Machine Image -{color:#FF0000}*If AND ONLY IF there are no instances of this image running*{color}


    [root@<your client>]# euca-deregister emi-1B3F163D
    IMAGE   emi-1B3F163D



Next deregister the image second time so that it will be wiped out of image listing also.


    [root@<your client>]# euca-deregister emi-1B3F163D
    IMAGE   emi-1B3F163D



Delete the bundle from storage. The {color:#FF0000}*most important switch is the --clear*{color} which stated that all files must be really deleted from filer.


    [root@exampleserver windows]# euca-delete-bundle -b ExampleImage --clear



This way the clusters storage will not be cluttered.

Also remember to delete the Eucalyptus Kernel (EKI) and Ramdisk (ERI) buckets same way.
